# Todo App — Data Structure & Cron Logic

## Models

### Header

```json
{
  "_id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "priority": "integer (0 to n-1)"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `priority` is unique and contiguous across all headers (0 to n-1)
- On **insert**: assign `priority = total number of existing headers` (add at end), no shifting needed
- On **delete**: shift all headers with `priority > deletedPriority` down by 1
- On **reorder**: swap or bulk-update priorities atomically

---

### Task

```json
{
  "_id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "notes": "string (optional)",
  "headerId": "ref → Header._id",
  "priority": "integer (0 to n-1, scoped per header)",
  "ecd": {
    "type": "enum: date | day_of_week | day_of_month | day_of_year",
    "value": "see ECD Types below"
  },
  "done": "boolean (default: false)",
  "doneAt": "ISO 8601 datetime | null (set when done → true, cleared on undo/reset)",
  "createdAt": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "updatedAt": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `priority` is scoped per `headerId` — two tasks in different headers can share the same priority value
- `updatedAt` must be refreshed on every write (toggling `done`, changing priority, editing any field)
- `doneAt` records **when** a task was completed: set to the current time when `done` flips to `true`, set back to `null` when `done` flips to `false` (by the user or by a cron reset)
- Every ECD change is logged to the `TaskArchive` collection as a `task_rescheduled` event (see Archive below)

**Priority assignment:**

- **New task added**: Insert at the position just before the first done task (1 below the last undone task). Shift all done tasks down by 1 to make room.
- **Task marked `done`**: Move to the last position (`priority = total tasks in header - 1`). Shift all tasks that were below it up by 1.
- **Task marked `not done`**: Move to the position just before the first done task (same as new task insertion). Shift all done tasks down by 1 to make room.

**Insertion point definition:** The "1 below last undone task" position is the index where done tasks begin. If there are no done tasks, insert at the end. If all tasks are done, insert at position 0.

---

### ECD Types

#### `date` — single one-time date

```json
{
  "type": "date",
  "value": "2026-04-10"
}
```

- `value` is an ISO 8601 date string (YYYY-MM-DD)

#### `day_of_week` — recurring on specific days of the week

```json
{
  "type": "day_of_week",
  "value": ["Mon", "Wed", "Fri"]
}
```

- `value` is an array of day name strings
- Allowed values: `Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun`

#### `day_of_month` — recurring on specific dates of the month

```json
{
  "type": "day_of_month",
  "value": [1, 15, 31]
}
```

- `value` is an array of integers (1–31)

#### `day_of_year` — recurring annually on a specific date

```json
{
  "type": "day_of_year",
  "value": "7/3/2006"
}
```

- `value` is a date string in `D/M/YYYY` format
- The year advances to the current year by the daily cron on the day the task
  comes due (see cron step 2)

---

### Event (reusable task bundle)

```json
{
  "_id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "tasks": ["string"],
  "createdAt": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "updatedAt": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `name` must be a non-empty string (trimmed)
- `tasks` must be a non-empty array of non-empty strings (each trimmed)
- Events are **templates only** — the backend never turns them into tasks.
  Clients schedule an event by posting one Task per selected entry (with a
  `date` ECD for the chosen day) under a Header named after the event — an
  existing header with that name is reused so later additions join it; a new
  one is created only when none exists
- Deleting an event never touches headers or tasks created from it
- The cron job ignores the Events collection entirely

---

### Goal (habit backlog, built one step at a time)

```json
{
  "_id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "steps": [{ "name": "string", "status": "pending | under_progress" }],
  "createdAt": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "updatedAt": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `name` must be a non-empty string (trimmed)
- `steps` is an ordered array (may be empty; defaults to `[]` on create) of
  objects with a non-empty `name` (trimmed) and a `status` of `pending`
  (backlog/paused) or `under_progress` (started — a lifelong daily habit);
  defaults to `pending`. Legacy values `active` and `achieved` are accepted
  and normalized to `under_progress`
- `steps` is replaced wholesale on update — clients send the full list to
  add, rename, reorder, remove or change the status of steps
- Goals are **roadmaps only** — the backend never turns steps into tasks.
  Clients start a step by posting a daily recurring Task (`day_of_week`, all
  seven days) under a Header named **"One Step At A Time"** — an existing
  header with that name is reused; a new one is created only when none exists
  (same find-or-create pattern as event scheduling). The task stays for life;
  pausing a step deletes it client-side, and clients also flip steps back to
  `pending` when the task (or the whole header) is deleted from the todo,
  keeping both views in sync
- Deleting a goal never touches headers or tasks created from its steps
- The cron job ignores the Goals collection entirely

---

### Project (long-term project, multi-step)

```json
{
  "_id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "priority": "number (0-based, contiguous across projects)",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD | null",
      "done": "boolean",
      "todoTaskId": "string | null"
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "updatedAt": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `name` must be a non-empty string (trimmed)
- `priority` is managed exactly like header priority: new projects append at
  the end (`count`), moves shift the affected neighbors, deletes close the
  gap — always contiguous `0..n-1`
- `tasks` is an ordered array (may be empty; defaults to `[]` on create) of
  objects with a non-empty `name` (trimmed), an optional `date`
  (`"YYYY-MM-DD"` or `null`, default `null`), an optional `done` boolean
  (default `false`) and an optional `todoTaskId` (string or `null`, default
  `null`)
- `tasks` is replaced wholesale on update — clients send the full list to
  add, rename, reorder, remove or change tasks. On **every** write the
  server re-sorts the list so undone tasks come before done tasks (stable) —
  marking a task done moves it to the bottom, same barrier as the todo
- The todo connection is client-driven (same find-or-create pattern as goals
  and event scheduling): giving a project task a `date` creates a one-time
  `date`-ECD Task in the todo under a Header named after the project (reused
  case-insensitively, created when missing) and stores its `_id` in
  `todoTaskId`. Clients keep both sides in sync: toggling done on either
  side flips the other, removing the date deletes the todo task, editing
  the todo task's name/date updates the project task (a cleared or
  recurring ECD sets the project date to `null`, keeping the link),
  reordering on either side mirrors the relative order of linked tasks on
  the other, deleting the todo task (or its header) clears `todoTaskId`
  **and** `date` on the project task, and renaming the project renames the
  header
- Cron step 5 completes the loop: when it deletes a done todo task whose
  `_id` appears as a `todoTaskId`, the project task is marked `done: true`
  with `todoTaskId` cleared (`date` is kept for the record) and the list is
  re-sorted — the task leaves the todo but is retained in the project as a
  completed step
- Deleting a project never touches headers or tasks created from its tasks

---

### Affirmation (short daily line)

```json
{
  "_id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "createdAt": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "updatedAt": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `name` must be a non-empty string (trimmed)
- Affirmations are completely independent of Headers/Tasks — a flat list
  sorted by `createdAt` ascending with plain CRUD
- The cron job ignores the Affirmations collection entirely

---

### Call (person to call biweekly or monthly)

```json
{
  "_id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "frequency": "biweekly | monthly",
  "done": "boolean",
  "doneAt": "ISO 8601 datetime | null",
  "createdAt": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "updatedAt": "ISO 8601 datetime"
}
```

**Rules:**

- `name` must be a non-empty string
- `frequency` must be `"biweekly"` (call twice a month) or `"monthly"` (once)
- Setting `done` to `true` stamps `doneAt`; setting it back to `false`
  clears `doneAt`
- Calls are completely independent of Headers/Tasks — a flat list sorted by
  `createdAt` ascending with plain CRUD
- The nightly cron resets `done` to `false` for **biweekly** calls on the
  15th of the month, and for **all** calls on the last day of the month
  (see cron step 7)

---

### TaskArchive (event log)

Append-only history collection (`TaskArchive`, or `TaskArchive-Test` in test
mode). All events carry `type`, `at` (insertion time), and a denormalized
`headerName` so history stays readable after headers are renamed or deleted.
Archive writes never throw — they can't break the operation that triggered
them.

| Event type         | Written by            | Meaning                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `habit_result`     | Cron step 0           | A `day_of_week` task's done/missed outcome for one scheduled day |
| `task_result`      | Cron step 0           | A `day_of_month` / `day_of_year` task's outcome for one cycle    |
| `task_completed`   | Cron step 5           | A one-time task captured (with `plannedFor`, `doneAt`) before deletion |
| `task_rescheduled` | `Task.update`         | An ECD change: `{ taskId, taskName, headerId, headerName, fromEcd, toEcd, pushedLater, reason }`. `pushedLater` is `true` when a one-time `date` moves later (a postpone). `reason` is the user's optional stated cause for the postpone (`null` when none, or when the reason was blank). A pushed-later reschedule with `reason: null` is unexcused procrastination; a valid stated reason is a legitimate deferral. The reason rides in on the `PUT /tasks/:id` body and is **never** written to the task document. |
| `task_deleted`     | `Task.delete`         | An **undone** task deleted manually, with the user's `reason`: `{ taskId, taskName, headerId, headerName, ecdType, ecd, reason, taskCreatedAt }`. Logged only for undone tasks (done tasks log nothing); `reason` is `null` when none is supplied. Header-cascade deletes (`Task.deleteByHeader`) are **not** archived. |
| `call_result`      | Cron step 7           | A call's done/missed outcome for one period, logged at the period boundary before the reset: `{ callId, callName, frequency, dueDate, completed, doneAt }` (`dueDate` = the reset day; no header fields — calls have no header) |

```json
{
  "type": "habit_result",
  "taskId": "uuid",
  "taskName": "Meditate",
  "headerId": "uuid",
  "headerName": "Health",
  "scheduledDays": ["Mon", "Wed", "Fri"],
  "dueDate": "2026-07-03",
  "completed": true,
  "doneAt": "2026-07-03T14:05:00Z",
  "at": "2026-07-04T00:00:01Z"
}
```

### Insight (AI reports)

The `Insights` collection stores one AI coaching report per generation:

```json
{
  "generatedAt": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "periodDays": 28,
  "model": "claude-opus-4-8",
  "stats": "exact computed stats the report was based on",
  "report": {
    "summary": "string",
    "habitsOnTrack": ["string"],
    "habitsSlipping": ["string"],
    "taskInsights": ["string"],
    "procrastinationFlags": ["string"],
    "deletionInsights": ["string"],
    "callReminders": ["string"],
    "suggestions": ["string"]
  }
}
```

Reports are generated at the end of every cron run (when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
is set) and on demand via `POST /insights/generate`. The previous report is
fed into the next generation so suggestions build on each other. Tasks
scheduled by `day_of_week` are treated as **habits**; everything else is a
task. Calls feed in two ways: `call_result` archive events become a `calls`
stats array (per person: `scheduled`, `completed`, `completionRate`,
`currentMissStreak`, `recentResults`), and the live call list is sent as
`currentCalls` so the report can flag people not yet called this period.
`callReminders` is required in newly generated reports (empty array when no
calls are set up) but absent from reports stored before the feature — clients
must tolerate its absence.

Manually deleting an **undone** task logs a `task_deleted` archive event with
the user's stated `reason`. These feed insights as a `deletions` stats block
(`{ count, withReason, recent }`, where `recent` items carry `taskName`,
`headerName`, `ecdType`, `reason`) plus a `deleted` count in each `byHeader`
bucket; the raw reasons ride along in the recent events. The report interprets
them as abandoned intentions — separating healthy pruning from avoidance — in a
required `deletionInsights` array (empty when nothing was deleted; absent from
reports stored before the feature, so clients must tolerate its absence).

---

## Cron Job

**Schedule:** Runs once daily at UTC midnight (`node-cron`, `Etc/UTC` timezone; UTC setInterval fallback). All day computations use UTC.

### Step-by-step Execution Order

#### Step 0 — Archive yesterday's recurring-task outcomes _(runs before any reset)_

A task scheduled for day X is reset at X 00:00 and completed during X, so its
outcome is only knowable at the following midnight:

- For every `day_of_week` task scheduled **yesterday**: log a `habit_result` event with `completed = task.done` and the task's `doneAt`
- For every `day_of_month` / `day_of_year` task due **yesterday**: log a `task_result` event the same way
- Idempotent: tasks already archived for that `dueDate` are skipped, so manual cron runs don't double-log

#### Step 1 — Clamp `day_of_month` values _(runs on the 1st of every month only)_

- For every task with `ecd.type === "day_of_month"`:
  - Determine the number of days in the current month
  - For each value in `ecd.value`, if the value exceeds the number of days in the month, clamp it to the last day of the month
  - If any value was changed, update `updatedAt`

#### Step 2 — Clamp & advance `day_of_year` _(runs daily)_

- For every task with `ecd.type === "day_of_year"` whose stored year is in the past:
  - If today's month/day matches the task's month/day: advance the year to the
    current year (e.g. `7/3/2006` → `7/3/2026`), set `done = false`,
    `doneAt = null`, and update `updatedAt`
  - On Feb 28 of a non-leap year, tasks stored as Feb 29 of a past year are
    clamped to Feb 28 of the current year and marked undone the same way
- Tasks whose stored year is the current year or later are skipped

#### Step 3 — Mark undone: `day_of_week`

- For every task with `ecd.type === "day_of_week"`:
  - If today's day name (e.g. `"Mon"`) is in `ecd.value`:
    - Set `done = false`, `doneAt = null`
    - Update `updatedAt`

#### Step 4 — Mark undone: `day_of_month`

- For every task with `ecd.type === "day_of_month"`:
  - If today's date number (1–31) is in `ecd.value`:
    - Set `done = false`, `doneAt = null`
    - Update `updatedAt`

#### Step 5 — Delete completed `date` tasks

- For every task with `ecd.type === "date"` (or no ECD):
  - If `done === true` → archive a `task_completed` event (preserving `plannedFor`, `createdAt`, `doneAt`, `headerName`), then **delete** the task
  - If `done === false` → do nothing
- After deleting, sync long-term projects: for every project task whose
  `todoTaskId` matches a deleted task's `_id`, set `done = true`, clear
  `todoTaskId` (keep `date` for the record) and re-sort the project's task
  list so done tasks sit at the bottom. The task leaves the todo but is
  retained in the project as a completed step. Counted in the run stats as
  `projectTasksCompleted`

#### Step 6 — Reorder priorities per header _(runs last)_

- For each header, collect all its tasks and sort as follows:
  1. **Undone tasks** (`done === false`) — sorted by next upcoming ECD date **ascending** → assigned priorities `0, 1, 2, ...` (sooner = closer to 0)
  2. **Done tasks** (`done === true`) — assigned the remaining higher priority values after all undone tasks
- Update `priority` and `updatedAt` on any task whose priority changed

##### Resolving "next upcoming ECD date" for sorting

| `type`         | Next due date                                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `date`         | The date value itself                                                         |
| `day_of_week`  | The nearest upcoming day from the `value` array                               |
| `day_of_month` | The nearest upcoming date in the current or next month from the `value` array |
| `day_of_year`  | The date stored in `value` (e.g. `7/3/2007`)                                  |

#### Step 7 — Archive call outcomes and reset calls _(runs on the 15th and on the last day of the month)_

- On the **15th of the month**: every **biweekly** call is due
- On the **last day of the month**: **all** calls (biweekly and monthly) are due
- For every due call (done **and** missed): log a `call_result` archive event
  `{ callId, callName, frequency, dueDate: today, completed: call.done, doneAt }`
  **before** resetting, so insights can track miss patterns (idempotent per
  `dueDate` — manual re-runs don't double-log)
- Then every due call that is done gets `done = false`, `doneAt = null`
- Biweekly = call twice a month, monthly = once
- The number of calls reset is reported as `callsReset` in the cron stats
  (archive events are not counted)

#### Final step — Generate the daily AI insight report

- After step 7, when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set (and not in test mode):
  - Compute exact stats over the last 28 days of `TaskArchive` events (habit completion rates, streaks, missed-by-weekday, task slippage, reschedule counts, per-person call completion and miss streaks)
  - Fetch the live call list and include it as `currentCalls` in the prompt payload
  - Send stats + recent events + the previous report to `claude-opus-4-8` with a structured-output schema
  - Store the result in the `Insights` collection
- Failures here never fail the cron run (logged, `insightGenerated: false` in stats)

}
```

---

### Tasks

#### `GET /tasks?headerId=:headerId`

Returns all tasks for a given header, sorted by `priority` ascending.

**Query params**

- `headerId` _(required)_ — filter tasks by header

**Response `200`**

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "uuid",
    "name": "Write report",
    "notes": "Include Q1 data",
    "headerId": "uuid",
    "priority": 0,
    "ecd": { "type": "date", "value": "2026-04-10" },
    "done": false,
    "createdAt": "2026-03-26T00:00:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-03-26T00:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

---

#### `POST /tasks`

Creates a new task. Priority is automatically assigned just before the first done task in the header.

**Request body**

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "notes": "string (optional)",
  "headerId": "uuid",
  "ecd": {
    "type": "date | day_of_week | day_of_month | day_of_year",

#### `POST /projects`

Creates a project. `name` required (non-empty, trimmed); `tasks` optional
(defaults to `[]`, validated and re-sorted undone-first as described in the
model rules). `priority` is auto-assigned (appended at the end).

**Response `201`** — the created project.

---

#### `PUT /projects/:id`

Updates `name`, `tasks` and/or `priority`. `tasks` is replaced wholesale and
re-sorted so done tasks sit at the bottom; `priority` moves shift the other
projects to stay contiguous (same as headers).

**Response `200`** — the updated project. **`400`** on validation errors
(including out-of-range priority), **`404`** when not found.

---

#### `DELETE /projects/:id`

Deletes a project and shifts remaining priorities. Headers/tasks previously
created from its dated tasks remain.

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "deleted": "uuid"
}
```

### Cron

#### `POST /cron/run`

Manually triggers the cron job. Accepts an optional `date` body override. Runs all steps in order:

0. Archive yesterday's habit/recurring outcomes (idempotent)
1. Clamp `day_of_month` values _(if today is the 1st)_
2. Clamp & advance `day_of_year` to the current year _(daily, when the task comes due)_
3. Mark undone: `day_of_week`
4. Mark undone: `day_of_month`
5. Archive + delete completed `date` tasks (and mark linked long-term project tasks done)
6. Reorder priorities per header
7. Reset calls _(biweekly calls on the 15th; all calls on the last day of the month)_
